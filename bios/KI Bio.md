Dr. John McLevey's research and teaching interests span the social, cognitive, and computational/statistical sciences. He primarily works in the fields of computational social science (especially natural language processing, Bayesian statistics, and generative modelling), social networks and complex system, affective and cognitive social science, and political and environmental sociology. He is currently the Principal Investigator for a number of projects funded by research grants from the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) and an Early Researcher Award from the Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation. His current work focuses on disinformation, censorship, influence and political cognition, and political deliberation in the public sphere across a wide variety of national contexts and political regimes. 

Outside of work, he generally spends his time playing basketball (wing or combo guard!); hiking; strength training; traveling (well, pre-COVID anyway...); taking photos; and spending time with his friends, family, and two hilarious cats Dorothy and Lando Catrissian. 

In the Department of Knowledge Integration, John primarily teaches “The Art & Science of Learning” (INTEG 120), “Research Design and Methods” (INTEG 340), “Computational Social Science” (INTEG 440/640), and “Bullshit, Bias, and Bad Arguments” (INTEG 240).
