# Leading and Engaging Connection Grant-type events

* Primary organizer (with Vanessa Schweizer and Mark Stoddart) of the 2015 workshop *Challenges and Opportunities for Governance of Socio-Ecological Systems in Comparative Perspective*

I was the primary organizer of the 2015 *Challenges and Opportunities for Governance of Socio-Ecological Systems in Comparative Perspective* workshop funded by The Balsillie School of International Affairs and the Faculty of Environment at the University of Waterloo. I worked with Vanessa Schweizer and Mark Stoddart to develop the idea for the workshop, secure funding, and then plan and manage the whole event. Planning the event included identifying and inviting participants, grouping submissions into themes, and fostering connections between researchers from a broad range of disciplinary backgrounds (e.g. sociology, political science, law, engineering, geography, and environmental science). 

* May 2014 "Funding, Fame, and Politics in the Think Tank World." Presented at *The Science Policy Interface: International Comparisons*, hosted by The Balsillie School of International Affairs, Waterloo, ON, Canada.  

I was a participant in a Connections Grant funded workshop on *The Science-Policy Interface in Comparative Perspective* led by Heather Douglas. I presented my research on how funding relationships and multi-institutional logics shapes the politics of policy ideas in Canada. I also contributed to the plans for a white paper eventually published by Heather Douglas.

* Participation in SEESHOP Workshops

For the last 3 years I have been participating in Connection Grant-like workshops funded by the European Research Council, and organized by Harry Collins, Robert Evans, and Martin Weinel. These workshops are typically attended by about 30 people from various European countries, Australia, the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Participants also come from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds, including sociology, political science, and law. 

# Outreach 

In addition to leading and participating in Connections Grant-like events, I have been involved in a variety of outreach activities. 

* Workshops on computational social science to high school students in Kitchener-Waterloo

As part of the outreach component of my Early Researcher Award from the Ministry of Research and Innovation, I hold annual outreach activities with high school students in the Waterloo region. For example, I led a workshop for 15 high school students on computational approaches to social science research, which included a hands-on session where students mapped and analyzed their own social networks, and articulated strategies for diversifying their networks. I am giving another workshop for 43 high school students on "Social Science Research in the Digital Age" on November 1 2017.     


* John McLevey and Liam Swiss. "[Tory war on evidence claims another casualty](http://bit.ly/1ohSn1N)." *Toronto Star* Op-Ed published on September 24 2014, section A15.  
* Public talks on science policy 

The op-ed I published with Liam Swiss in *The Toronto Star* focused mostly on the effects of changes in the funding environment for social scientific policy researchers (including think tanks) under the Harper Conservatives. In addition to the op-ed, I have given public talks at *Evidence for Democracy* events, including a public event at the University of Waterloo called *Talk Science*, which was attended by the general public, local media, and members of the four main political parties. I spoke mainly on funding effects for policy research, the state of science communication in Canada, and the effects of muzzling federal scientists on evidence-based public policy debates.
