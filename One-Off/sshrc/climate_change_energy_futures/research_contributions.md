# 2. Other Research Contributions

## 2.1 Research Software  

\href{http://networkslab.org/metaknowledge/}{\textbf{metaknowledge}}: A Python package for quantitative and social networks research in the sociology of science and information science. Designed and developed by John McLevey, students Reid McIlroy-Young, and Jillian Anderson. First released in 2015. Under active development. \emph{Supported in part by funding from SSHRC.}  

\href{http://networkslab.org/gitnet/}{\textbf{gitnet}}: A Python package for mining source code repository and mailing list data and generating network datasets. Designed and developed by Joel Becker, Jillian Anderson, Steve McColl, and John McLevey. First released in 2016. Under active development. \emph{Supported in part by funding from SSHRC and an Early Researcher Award from the Ministry of Research and Innovation.}

## 2.2 Policy Research / Program Evaluation Studies

Janice Aurini, John McLevey, Allyson Stokes, and Rob Gorbet. 2017. ``Classroom Robotics and Acquisition of 21st Century Competencies: An Action Research Study of Nine Ontario School Boards.'' Research Report for the Ministry of Education, Ontario and the Council of Ontario Directors of Education (CODE).

# 3. Most Significant Career Research Contributions

## Research Article

\begin{itemize}
    \item[\textbf{R*}] John McLevey. 2014. ``Think Tanks, Funding, and the Politics of Policy Knowledge in Canada.'' \emph{Canadian Review of Sociology / Revue canadienne de sociologie}. 51(1):54-75.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Significance}: This article analyzes original funding data collected from Information Returns for 30 think tanks from 2000 to 2011. It shows how Canadian think tank funding is structured by a growing opposition between donor funded conservatives and state funded centrists. It contributes to an emerging field theory of think tanks and policy knowledge, and brings evidence to a debate about think tanks that has long been dominated by political rhetoric. In addition to the academic contributions, this article has been used by organizations, like the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, that are currently reviewing their funding models. It has also resulted in several invitations to speak about science policy in Canada, and to contribute in an advisory role to science policy white papers.

## Research Software

\begin{itemize}
\item[\textbf{*}] \href{http://networkslab.org/metaknowledge/}{\emph{metaknowledge}}: A Python package for quantitative and social networks research in the sociology of science and information science. Designed and developed by John McLevey, Reid McIlroy-Young, and Jillian Anderson. First released in 2015. \emph{Supported in part by funding from SSHRC.}  
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Significance}: This open source software is designed to facilitate large-scale computational research on scientific networks, including the evolution and structure of disciplinary and interdisciplinary research over time. Since 2015, it has been downloaded thousands of times. In addition to academic research, it is starting to be adopted by librarians and institutional researchers at the University of Waterloo and other research universities.

## Students Trained as Research Assistants 

As of 2015, I run a lab group at the University of Waterloo that focuses on social network analysis and computational sociology ([http://networkslab.org/](http://networkslab.org/)). Student work is funded in part by SSHRC grants and an Early Researcher Award from the Ministry of Research and Innovation. Students in this lab learn computational research methods in addition to mainstream sociological research methods. There are currently **6 students** being trained in this lab (4 PhD Students and 2 Undergraduate Students). Four research assistants have now graduated and have been replaced. One is now a fellow at the Berkman Center at Harvard University, another is a Master's student in the Computational Social Science graduate program at the University of Chicago, another is a Master's student in the Data Science program at Simon Fraser University, and another is now a Data Scientist for the federal government. In addition to my own students in NetLab, I am co-supervising three PhD Student research assistants on SSHRC-funded projects that I am a co-applicant on, and three PhD Student research assistant on a contract research project with the Council of Ontario Directors of Education (CODE) and the Ministry of Education in Ontario.
