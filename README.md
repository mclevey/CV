# CV

Running `bash compile_cv.sh` will print some messages to the terminal, or you can just run `msg pipeline cv .`, where `.` represents the cv directory. Note that `msg` expects the directory to contain a file called `cv.md` and a file called `config.yaml`, both of which contain `yaml` data. See the `msg` documentation (coming soon) for more details.

# Environment

Transitioning to Poetry, but haven't made it here yet... `conda activate mstk`.
